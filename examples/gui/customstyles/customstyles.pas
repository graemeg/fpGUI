    Description:
      This example demonstrates how to define a new theme/style and how
      to use it. Styles can be changed at runtime via the --style parameter.
      eg:

        $ ./customestyle --style 'Demo Style'
        $ ./customestyle --style Win2000
        $ ./customestyle --style 'demo style'

      Note that the style name is not case sensitive. Also if the style
      name consists of more than one word, in needs to be between single
      quotes.
}

  { Set our new style as the default (before we create any forms), unless
    a the end-user specified a different style via the command line. }
  if not gCommandLineParams.IsParam('style') then
    if fpgStyleManager.SetStyle('Demo Style') then
      fpgStyle := fpgStyleManager.Style;

  frm := TTestForm.Create(nil);

    frm.Show;
    fpgApplication.Run;
  finally
    frm.Free;
  end;
