<h2>Introduction<a name="toc0001"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>In 
this article I would like to introduce my work called <b><nobr>Anti-Grain</nobr>
 Geometry</b> (<b>AGG</b>).
It is an Open Source, free of charge 2D graphic library, written in
industrially standard C++.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Scalable
 2D vector graphics is widely used in all kinds
of applications and now the performance of modern processors
makes it affordable to use <b>high quality</b> vector graphics.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>High
 quality means multilevel Anti-Aliasing and subpixel accuracy.
Subpixel accuracy is often underestimated, but in general it's very
important to have a possibility of subpixel positioning.
It's especially important to be able to set fractional line width
that can be even less than one pixel. I would say that Anti-Aliased
rendering is practically useless without subpixel accuracy.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
first question that can arise is <i>&#8220;What is this needed for?&#8221;</i>
or even <i>&#8220;Is there a need of yet another reinvention of the wheel?&#8221;</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
short answer is as follows.
Yes, there are many graphic standards, protocols and libraries, but
nothing that fits all my needs. It was my main motivation to start
<b>AGG</b>, namely, my exclusive requirements. Later other people
found it very interesting too.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>You 
can think of <b>AGG</b> as of a rendering library that creates raster
images in memory from some vectorial representation. But this definition
is just the first approximation. In general, you can use any part of the
library, not obligatory as a rasterizer or renderer.
<b>AGG</b> can be used in many applications where there is a need for 
high
quality and fast 2D graphics. It can be GIS/cartography applications,
fancy looking graphic user interfaces, different kinds of charts and 
diagrams,
CAD/CAM, and so on. Besides, <b>AGG</b> is platform independent, 
lightweight,
compact, and robust It also can be perfectly used in embedded systems
and mobile devices.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>


<br><h2>Brief Overview of Graphic Libraries<a name="toc0002"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>First,
 let me briefly describe the existing tools
and libraries that can be used as 2D rendering engines.
The fastest software 2D renderer that produces images of
appropriate quality is well known Macromedia Flash viewer.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
other one is SVG standard from W3C committee,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG"><img 
src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" border="0">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG</a>/
 for which we can find a number of
viewers (the most advanced one is Adobe SVG, <a 
href="http://www.adobe.com/svg"><img src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" 
border="0">http://www.adobe.com/svg</a>/).
But they both are &#8220;end-user&#8221; applications and cannot be used as
rendering libraries available from C++. SVG would be the best 2D
standard if there were available implementations that support the
whole SVG specification and provide appropriate quality, performance,
and consume reasonable amount of memory.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
most widely used industrial libraries available from many languages
are OpenGL, Apple Quartz and GDI+.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>OpenGL
 is good and standard, but the quality of 2D graphics is very poor.
It's perfectly &#8220;hardware accelerated&#8221;, but there are no available
accelerators that produce any valuable quality of 2D graphics.
Alex Eddy has performed a research that clearly shows the lack of the
quality in most popular OpenGL accelerators.

src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" border="0">http://homepage.mac.com/arekkusu/bugs/invariance</a>/</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>GDI+
 has also very poor quality of rendering, it's slow and
has too many bugs to be used in practice, not to mention
that it's available only on Microsoft Windows platform.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Apple
 Quartz has the most advanced API and quality, but it's available
only on Apple computers.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>There
 are two Open Source libraries, LibArt by Raph Levien
<a href="http://www.levien.com/libart"><img 
src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" border="0">http://www.levien.com/libart</a>/
 and Cairo Graphics, <a href="http://cairographics.org/"><img 
src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" border="0">http://cairographics.org</a>/.
LibArt
 development was abandoned some time ago, and the problems with
numerical stability don't allow you to use it in practice.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Cairo
 Graphics is in active development and it is definitely worth
considering. Still, Cairo Graphics has certain limitations, mostly
because of its hardcoded rendering model.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Besides,
 LibArt and Cairo Graphics are released under LGPL license
which is too restrictive in many cases.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Another
 very good library is called ImageMagick (<a 
href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"><img src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" 
border="0">http://www.imagemagick.org</a>),
but its primary purpose is image processing.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
general problem of all existing graphic libraries and
tools is that they are too restrictive. They all are &#8220;black boxes&#8221;,
even open source ones.
I feel I need to explain this statement. Theoretically you can modify
an open source library in any way you want (assuming that it doesn't
contradict the license). But as soon as you modify a single byte you
create another branch of the library and have to take care of merging
your modifications with new versions from the authors. After some point
it becomes a nightmare. In my opinion the real &#8220;openness&#8221; of the library
appears when you can extend its functionality without having to modify a
single character in the distributed code. C++ allows us to do that.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><h2>The power of templates in C++<a name="toc0003"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p><b>AGG</b>
 uses C++ class and function templates very actively. The same
functionality can be achieved using dynamic polymorphism, that is,
classes with overridden virtual functions. But the templates allow
you to optimize the code having very flexible and convenient design.
Polymorphic classes work quite well until a certain level of 
detailization.
A typical task in vector graphics is to have a vertex conversion 
pipeline.
For example, it can be some source of vectorial commands like
MoveTo/LineTo/CurveTo, then there is a converter that &#8220;flattens&#8221; curves,
then a stroke generator, then affine transformer and so on. In most 
graphic
libraries the pipelines are hardcoded.
If we want it to be more flexible, that is, if we want to construct 
custom
pipelines, you will have to use polymorphism. It's appropriate to have
one virtual call per vertex but can be too expensive to have a virtual
call per vertex per pipeline element. Another approach is to have
&#8220;static&#8221; polymorphism, that is, to use class templates. It does not 
directly
allow you to construct pipelines dynamically, at run time, but in most 
cases
you don't really need it. Most probably you only want to have a 
possibility to
construct pipelines at compile time, and if you really need dynamic
polymorphism it's very easy to write polymorphic wrappers whose 
interfaces
are compatible with what the templates expect. So that, in <b>AGG</b>
it's you who has full control upon the functionality and performance.
The very same approach is used in the raster part of the rendering
pipeline. You can write your own low level renderers that work with
different color spaces, your own gradient functions, your own span
generators, and so on. An implementation based on classical
polymorphic classes would cost you several virtual calls per each pixel,
while templates allow you to do so for no extra overhead.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><h2>The key features of AGG<a name="toc0004"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Below
 I just enumerate the key features of the library, so that you

<br><h2>Architecture<a name="toc0005"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p><b>AGG</b>
 doesn't have any predefined rendering model, it's like
"a tool to create other tools". The architecture and the
philosophy of the library is determined by the main goal
of its creation. The goal is to have a set of 2D tools united
with a common idea. You and only you define the resulting architecture 
and
rendering model. <b>AGG</b> is open and flexible but not that
obvious and easy to use as other "conventional" libraries like
GDI+ or Quartz.
Besides, it makes sense to mention that <b>AGG</b> has some
restrictions too, but it's only because some algorithms and
design solutions are not yet implemented.
In particular, <b>AGG</b> currently supports only path-based model,
and there is no straight way to render graphics from Macromedia
Flash format. Flash is edge-based, so, you can render a multi-color
scene in one pass. In some cases it's better, but in general it's
more restrictive and more difficult in use. Currently we can say
that <b>AGG</b> is more SVG centric rather than Flash centric.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

rendering engine based on <b>AGG</b>.

<h3>Pixel Format Renderers<a name="toc0006"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Pixel
 format renderers perform basic alpha-blending operations
in the resulting frame buffer. They do not perform any clipping,
thus, it's unsafe to use them directly, so, if the coordinates are
out of range it can result in undefined behaviour, most probably
segmentation fault. It doesn't mean that the design is bad, it
means that you can write your own color space and pixel format
renderers, and you don't need to worry about clipping because
it is already provided on a higher level.
It's quite possible to write a renderer to work in another color
space, say, XYZ or Lab, and define your own color type.
These additions will not affect anyhow the other parts of <b>AGG</b>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Currently
 <b>AGG</b> provides 15, 16, 24, and 32 bits RGB and RGBA
pixel formats.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Alpha-Mask Adaptor<a name="toc0007"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Alpha-mask
 adaptor allows you to use an additional
transparency channel when rendering. Strictly speaking
there can be any kind of an adaptor. Alpha-mask is just
an example of it.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
                 
<h3>Basic Renderers<a name="toc0008"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
basic renderer (<a 
href="http://www.antigrain.com/doc/basic_renderers/basic_renderers.agdoc.html#renderer_base">renderer_base</a>)
 accepts a pixel format
renderer as its template argument and it's main purpose is
level clipping. It provides essentially the same interface as
pixel format renderers.
Also, there is <a 
href="http://www.antigrain.com/doc/basic_renderers/basic_renderers.agdoc.html#renderer_mclip">renderer_mclip</a>
 which is the same in use
but it can perform clipping to a number of arbitrary
rectangles.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Scanline Renderer<a name="toc0009"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>One 
of the key concepts in <b>AGG</b> is the scanline. The scanline
is a container that consist of a number of horizontal spans that
can carry Anti-Aliasing information. The scanline
renderer decomposes provided scanline into a number of spans
and in simple cases (like solid fill) calls basic renderer.
In more complex cases it can call span generator.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Span Generator<a name="toc0010"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Span
 Generator is used in all cases that are more difficult
than solid fill. It's a common mechanism that can produce
any kind of color spans, such as gradients, Gouraud shading,
image transformations, pattern fill, and so on. Particularly
this mechanism allows you to transform a part of the image
bounded with an arbitrary shape with Anti-Aliased edges.
The span generator can consist of the whole pipeline,
for example, there can be an image transformer plus alpha
(transparency) gradient.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Scanline Rasterizer<a name="toc0011"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
scanline rasterizer accepts a number of arbitrary polygons
as its input and produces anti-aliased scanlines. This is
the primary rendering technique in <b>AGG</b>. It means that
the only shape that can be rasterized is a polygon (poly-polygon
to be exact). If you need to draw a line you need to calculate
at least four points that define its outline. At the first sight
it can seem like an overkill, but it isn't. The main point is
that the algorithm uses subpixel accuracy and correctly rasterizes
any shapes, even when a single pixel is crossed by the edges many
times. It allows the result to remain consistent regardless
of the scale and the algorithm guarantees that there will be
no defects.

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
initial idea was taken from the rasterizer
of FreeType font engine by David Turner (<a 
href="http://www.freetype.org/"><img src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" 
border="0">http://www.freetype.org</a>).
David kindly allowed me to rewrite the rasterizer in C++ and
release the code independently.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Such

scanline_renderer <span class="larger">&#8594;</span> base_renderer <span 
class="larger">&#8594;</span> pixel_format)
allows us to implement very interesting algorithms, for example,
renderers optimized for LCD color triplets (like Microsoft ClearType) 
and
it will be applicable to all primitives, not only for text.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Outline Renderers<a name="toc0012"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>This
 is yet another algorithm of drawing Anti-Aliased lines.
The use of the algorithm is more limited than the scanline rasterizer,
but it also has many advantages.
</p><ul type="disc">
<li>It works about 2&#8230;3 times faster than the scanline rasterizer.</li>
<li>It allows you to have the Anti-Aliased area of any profile and 
width.</li>
<li>The Anti-Aliasing algorithm is distance-based, unlike area-based
   in the scanline rasterizer. In most cases it allows you to produce
   better visual result.</li>
<li>Most importantly, the algorithm allows you to use an arbitrary
   image as the line pattern.
   This is the key capability when rendering high quality
   geographic maps.
In general we can say that it's dedicated for fast drawing of
relatively thin polylines.</li></ul><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Outline Rasterizer<a name="toc0013"></a></h3>
                       
<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
outline rasterizer is just an adaptor that unifies the use of
the solid outline rasterizer and the one with image patterns.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Vertex Conversion Pipeline<a name="toc0014"></a></h3>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
vertex pipeline consists of a number of converters.
Each converter accepts an abstract Vertex Source as the input
and works as another Vertex Source. Usually graphic libraries
have hardcoded pipelines, typically they consist of a curve
decomposer (that converts curves to a number of short line segments),
affine transformer, dash generator, stroke generator,
and polygon clipper.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>In <b>AGG</b>
 you can construct custom pipelines and there can be as many
pipelines as you need. Besides, the pipelines can have branches, in
other words you can extract vertices from any point of the pipeline.
The most important thing is you can combine the converters as
you want and get quite different results.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><h2>Example<a name="toc0015"></a></h2>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
example below demonstrates how to create basic types needed
for rendering and the effect of the pipelines. To keep the things
as simple as possible it will be a console application that
produces a raster file (result.ppm) that has a very simple format.
You can display this files with many kinds of viewers, for example,
IrfanView (<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/"><img 
src="ddj1.agdoc_files/link.gif" border="0">http://www.irfanview.com</a>/).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>Also
 I'd like to mention that it's not necessary for <b>AGG</b> to have
any building environment. It has automake/autoconfig files, but you
can do without them. Since <b>AGG</b> doesn't depend on any 
platform-specific
tools you can just include all necessary source files into your
project/makefile and they will perfectly compile and work.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

At the first sight it looks like now the stroke is thinner. But
it's more complex than that. Note that the width of the stroke is
not uniform. I intentionally set different scaling coefficients
by X and Y to demonstrate that you can control the result by
changing the order of the converters.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

the last example let us demonstrate some non-linear transformation
effects. It will be a circular warp magnifier. But since the
transformation is non-linear, we can't just transform vertices, we need
to prepare the initial path in such a way that the initial vectors
would consist of many short line segments. Of course, we could do
that when adding vertices to the path storage, but there is a better
way. We use an additional intermediate converter that segments long
vectors. It's <a

 examples demonstrate the main principle of <b>AGG</b> design, that is
that you have full control upon your rendering model and required
capabilities. The declarations can look too complex, but first,
they can be simplified with the use of <code>typedef</code>s, and 
second,
they usually are not seen outside. You just create a problem oriented
wrapper once and use it as a conventional graphic library.
The pipelines that support capabilities of SVG, GDI+, or say,
PDF are very simple. The last example just demonstrates that
it's very easy to extend the functionality. In the examples
the pipeline is defined statically, at the compile time, which
is suitable in most cases. But the template mechanism allows you
to write simple polymorphic wrappers and construct the pipelines
dynamically, at run-tume.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
raster pipelines are organized in a similar way, but they are
usually much simpler. After the vectorial shape is rasterized you can
do the following:</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p></p><ul
 type="disc">
<li>Fill the shape with a solid color and possible transparency.</li>
<li>Fill with an arbitrary gradient. All possible transformations
   are applicable to the gradients as well.</li>
<li>Fill the shape with a transformed image. There many different
   Anti-Aliasing filter are available, from simple bilinear to
   high degree Lancosz and Blackman ones.</li>
<li>Fill the shape with an arbitrary pattern.</li>
<li>Apply an alpha-mask.</li>
<li>Apply a number of Scanline Boolean Algebra operations, such as,
   Intersection, Union, Difference, and XOR between two or more
   scanline shapes.</li></ul><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p>The 
number of possibilities is practically endless, and the point
is that you can always write your own algorithms and span
generators and insert them into the pipeline.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table width="640px"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: justify;"><p><b>AGG</b>
 has many other interesting algorithms, in particular, using
raster images as line patterns. This is a very powerful mechanism
for cartography and similar applications and I haven't seen
any valuable implementation of it so far.
