      <short>Extra interpolation filter declarations.</short>
      <descr>
        <p>This unit defines more interpolation filters for <link id="fpg_base.TfpgCanvasBase.StretchDraw">TfpgCanvasBase.StretchDraw</link>:<br/>
Bessel, Gaussian and Sinc are infinite impulse response (IIR),
the others are finite impulse response (FIR). The implementation
of Bessel and Sinc are windowed with Blackman filter.</p>
        <p>This unit was ported from fcl-image which is part of FPC. A few
more filters have also been added.</p>
