This directory contains a zipped copy of the FreeType32.dll and FreeType64.dll files.
This is required if you use the Agg enabled Canvas, and have the FreeType font
engine enabled.  Use 32bit or 64bit to match the platform you compile for.

The FreeType font engine has more functionality and better looking output
than the Win32 font engine.
